# MyToken

MyToken is an ERC20-compliant token contract implemented in Solidity.

## Overview

MyToken allows for the creation, minting, burning, and transfer of tokens based on the ERC20 standard. It also includes ownership functionalities to control token management.

## Features

- *ERC20 Compliance*: Implements the ERC20 standard for compatibility with Ethereum token standards.
- *Minting*: Allows the contract owner to mint new tokens.
- *Burning*: Enables token holders to burn (destroy) their tokens.
- *Ownership*: Provides ownership functionalities for token management.

## Installation

To deploy the contract, you need to have an Ethereum development environment set up. You'll also need access to the OpenZeppelin contracts.

1. Clone the repository:


git clone <repository-url>


2. Install dependencies:


npm install


3. Compile the contracts:


npx hardhat compile


4. Deploy the contracts to your preferred Ethereum network:


npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>


## Usage

Once deployed, you can interact with the contract using Ethereum wallets, DApps, or smart contracts. Here are some common actions:

- *Transfer Tokens*: Use the transfer function to send tokens to another address.
- *Mint Tokens*: Call the mint function to create new tokens.
- *Burn Tokens*: Invoke the burn function to destroy existing tokens.
